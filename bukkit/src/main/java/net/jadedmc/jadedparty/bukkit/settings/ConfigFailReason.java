    /*
    Will add these later.
    Goal is to make the config get checked on plugin startup and config reload for any errors that could break it.
    Some examples:
      empty party id alphabet
      party id minimum or maximum is too low
      party id minimum is bigger than maximum
      standalone is set to false but the cache type is set to memory
      cache type is set to redis but redis database isn't configured
